    "# 1. What is Data Science?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data. It combines statistics, computer science, domain expertise, and communication skills to solve real-world problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "- **Data Collection:** Gathering raw data from various sources (databases, sensors, web, etc.)\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning:** Removing errors, handling missing values, and preparing data for analysis\n",
    "- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Summarizing and visualizing data to find patterns\n",
    "- **Modeling:** Using statistical and machine learning models to make predictions or classifications\n",
    "- **Interpretation & Communication:** Explaining results to stakeholders and making data-driven decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- **Healthcare:** Predicting disease outbreaks, optimizing treatment plans, analyzing patient data for better outcomes.\n",
    "- **Finance:** Fraud detection, credit risk assessment, micro-loans (e.g., M-Pesa in Kenya).\n",
    "- **Marketing:** Personalized recommendations, customer segmentation (e.g., Jumia in Africa).\n",
    "- **Agriculture:** Forecasting crop yields, optimizing irrigation using sensor data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why learn data science?**\n",
    "- High demand for data skills in the job market\n",
    "- Enables evidence-based decisions\n",
    "- Useful in research, business, government, and more\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diagram:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Data Collection] → [Cleaning] → [EDA] → [Modeling] → [Interpretation]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway:**\n",
    "Data science is about turning raw data into actionable insights that drive real change."

    "  ```bash\n",
    "  conda create -n ds_env python=3.10\n",
    "  conda activate ds_env\n",
    "  conda install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy statsmodels sqlalchemy\n",
    "  jupyter notebook\n",
    "  ```\n",

    "  ```bash\n",
    "  python -m venv venv\n",
    "  venv\\Scripts\\activate  # On Windows\n",

    "- **Merge:** Combine changes from different branches\n",
    "- **GitHub/GitLab:** Online platforms for sharing and collaborating\n",

    "**Essential Git Commands**\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "   git add hello.py\n",
    "   git commit -m \"Initial commit: hello world script\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. Check your commit history with `git log`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practice:**\n",
    "- Write clear commit messages (what/why, not just \"update\")\n",
    "- Commit often, but only working code\n",
    "- Use branches for new features or experiments\n",
    "\n",
